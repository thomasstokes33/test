        <p>It is important to remember that html is structure, css is design and JavaScript is the interact.<p>
        <p>When combined they are very powerful. I would recommed first taking the basic codecademy tutorial on HTML(so up to bot not including tables). 
            Then the microsoft learn modules https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/ . The codecademy tutorial allows you to understand the
            basics and the microsoft lessons use this new found knowleddge. I would then reccommend finishing the codecademy tutorials on html, css and javascript
            interlinked with https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/ . This site is beautifully designed and a nice break from the occasionally repetitve(albeit addicting)
             interface of codecademy.

        <p>The main principle is that html is the text and structure, css shows where and how everything is displayed and javascript adds any sort of applet 
            . Furthermore it connects to the real world to understand say time.
